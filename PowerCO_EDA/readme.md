# 📊 Customer Churn Analysis | Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Understanding your customers is the first step toward keeping them. This **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** project dives deep into PowerCo’s customer behavior to uncover patterns, trends, and hidden insights that drive **customer churn**.

Through detailed analysis and visualization, this project sets the stage for **predictive modeling** and **strategic retention planning**—empowering PowerCo to make **data-informed decisions** that fuel growth and customer loyalty.

## 🎯 Project Objective

- Conduct a comprehensive analysis of customer data.
- Identify **key factors** contributing to customer churn.
- Segment customers by **product usage**, **consumption patterns**, and **seasonality**.
- Provide **actionable insights** to support data-driven strategy and future modeling.

---

## 🔍 Key Insights from EDA

- **Product Engagement**:  
  Over **78% of customers** use only **one product**, correlating with **higher churn rates**.

- **Churn by Season**:  
  Churn spikes in **Q1** and **June**, likely due to **price adjustments** and **seasonal consumption shifts**.

- **Consumption Segmentation**:  
  Customers fall into **Low (42%)**, **Medium (32%)**, and **High (25%)** consumption groups.  
  **Medium and High users** churn more frequently, potentially targeted by competitors.

- **Service Type Analysis**:  
  Despite the majority (81.8%) using **electricity**, churn is nearly **even** across gas and electricity users, indicating **pricing dissatisfaction** across the board.

# DataScienceProjectBCGForage
This BCG Forage project for Power Co, an electricity company, addresses the issue of client churn. The task is to conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the provided data, engineer meaningful features for enhanced insights, and develop a churn classification machine learning algorithm to predict and mitigate customer attrition.

# Project Overview
In this BCG Forage project for Power Co, an electricity company facing client churn, I performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to analyze the data, create data visualizations, and apply mathematical modeling and statistical analysis. This process helped uncover insights and identify the underlying reasons for customer churn.

# Part 2
The second part of the project involved creating seven new features related to consumption, date, contract renewal, price combinations, and the price of energy consumption. These features were designed to uncover and better understand the factors driving customer churn, providing deeper insights into the forces behind client attrition.

# Part 3
The third part of the project focused on creating and optimizing a Random Forest algorithm, along with implementing several evaluation methods to assess the model's performance. The result was a model with 91% accuracy. Next steps include applying Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction, utilizing a stronger SMOTE algorithm for dataset balancing, and conducting feature importance analysis to select the most relevant features for the algorithm.

# Part 4
Part 4 involved creating a presentation to effectively communicate the findings to the potential client. While still learning, I aimed to clearly explain the churn issue, provide deeper data-driven insights, and offer recommendations. Additionally, I proposed further analysis and the development of smart systems to help address the problem.
